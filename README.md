# 🧠 Dissertation: [Your Dissertation Title Here]

### 🎓 Overview
This repository contains the data and analysis materials from my undergraduate dissertation for my **BSc Psychology with Cognitive Neuroscience** degree.  
The project investigated **[insert a short summary of what you studied — e.g., how cognitive load and attention influence decision-making accuracy]**.

The focus of this project was to apply data analysis, statistical reasoning, and visualization techniques to explore cognitive performance patterns across experimental conditions.

---

### 📊 Objectives
- To explore how [main independent variable] affects [dependent variable or outcome].
- To apply data cleaning and analysis techniques using **Excel** and **JASP**.
- To interpret the results through descriptive statistics and inferential testing.

---

### 🧩 Dataset Description
The data is fully anonymized and represents participant scores collected during the study.

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ID` | Participant code (anonymized) |
| `A1C_S1` – `A2O_S4` | Accuracy or response time values across different experimental conditions (scale 0–1) |

- `dissertation_data_clean.xlsx` — primary dataset  
- `summary_statistics.xlsx` — aggregated descriptive results  
- `raw_data.xlsx` — secondary dataset (if applicable)

---

### 🧮 Analysis
Data was analyzed using:
- **Excel** — data cleaning, organization, descriptive statistics, and pivot tables  
- **JASP** — inferential statistics (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests, correlation analysis)

Exported results and charts are included in the `/analysis/` and `/visuals/` folders.

---

### 📈 Visuals
Example visual outputs (charts and summary tables) from the analysis:
- Mean performance by condition
- Reaction time distribution
- Accuracy comparison across groups

*(You can add actual screenshots or `.png` files in the `/visuals` folder and link them here like:)*  
`![Accuracy Chart](visuals/accuracy_chart.png)`

### 🧰 Tools Used
- **Excel** for data cleaning and descriptive analysis  
- **JASP** for statistical testing and visualization  
- **Python (optional)** for exploratory data checks  
- **GitHub** for version control and transparency

### 📘 Report
The full dissertation report is available in the `/report/` folder:  
📄 **[Dissertation_Report.pdf](report/Dissertation_Report.pdf)**

---

### 🧠 Key Findings (optional but powerful)
- [Insert 2–3 short insights from your results, e.g.:]  
  - Higher cognitive load significantly reduced decision accuracy (p < .05).  
  - Participants performed best under moderate time constraints.
